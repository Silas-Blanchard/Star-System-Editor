Star System Editor created for use by users of https://amaranth-legacy.fandom.com/wiki/Amaranth_Legacy_Wiki

Originally inspired by discord user @theminmusderp, this project was meant to expedite the creation of maps of star systems.

Downloadable JAR file coming soon (if you can trust a rando JAR file from online).

Coded in Javafx for those who want to run the code themselves.
